This is a sliding puzzle app that uses photos from www.reddit.com/r/earthporn.json

Being able to download images keeps the app light, and the puzzles always interesting.
It uses a few iOS 8 APIs so will only run on those devices.

Things I got done:

- Universal iPad Support. Looks awesome.
- Downloading and Caching of images from the above mentioned subreddit. (Thanks to SDWebImage for the easy caching).
- App Icon.
- Tap to move tile. 
- Tiles can be dragged into position.
- Move counter.

Things I wish I had time to do:

- Sliding entire rows. 
- Support for device rotation.
- Backwards compatibility for devices running versions of iOS prior to iOS8.
- Music/SoundFX
- Allowing users to select difficulty and number of tiles.
- Infinite scrolling on image selection screen. (For now, loading more requires pulling to refresh)
- Some cleanup and error handling.
